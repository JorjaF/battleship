# Battleship 

## Background
Battleship is a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board, and then take turns trying to “sink” the other player’s ships by guessing their coordinates. The game ends when one player’s ships are all hit and “sunk”. For more information, see the Wikipedia page.

## Learning Goals
- Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Practice algorithmic thinking
- Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
- Work in a pair, using Pull Requests to collaborate

## Overview
In this project you’ll use Ruby to build a command line implementation of the classic game Battleship. 

## Written Reflection:

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem solving process.
 - We approached Iteration 3 by looking at the behaviors we were expecting from the class and game flow. We let these expectations guide our test writing then created methods to make our tests pass. 


If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
 - More refactoring. Getting the random placement to work (it was SO close!) and cleaning up the board class methods. 


Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

 - We used the ping pong method when we were working async and used the driver/navigtor method when working together live in live sessions. 


Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
 - Partners remained open to giving and receiving feedback. Partners felt comfortable sharing thoughts and questions openly and checked in with each other.
